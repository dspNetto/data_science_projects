# Diego Netto
<sub>*Electrical and Electronic Engineer*</sub>

I am an Engineering professional with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree focused in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and a demonstrated history of working in the automotive industry.

I always seek new ideas and possibilities. I value intelligence, knowledge, and competence and I consider myself an ambitious and self-confident person. People that know me highlights my creativity and my attention to details. I like to always have in hands a plan for each task that I get involved and I am usually elaborating and using checklists and flowcharts. I always seek impartiality in decisions relying on logic and facts. When I see opportunity, I question and challenge the existing procedures instead of accepting the argument that things have always been done in this way.

I am also honest, direct, rational, and ethical and I value the same in others around me.
